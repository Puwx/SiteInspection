# SiteInspection

This script and tool is used to create individual png maps for each of the features in a feature class.
It is pretty close in functionality with Data Driven Pages (DDP) but doesn't require you to open ArcMap to actually create the maps.
This tool also adds the ability of exporting to multiple scales when creating the maps rather than a single one like in DDP.

**In order to use this script the folder structure below must be used:**
+ SiteInspection (Base Folder)
  + SiteInspection.tbx (ArcToolbox)
      + SiteInspection (ArcMap Script Tool)
  + SiteInspectionMap.mxd
  + SiteInspection.py
  
** Basically just download this repository and don't mess around with the folder structure **
